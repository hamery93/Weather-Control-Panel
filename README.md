A Better way to View the Weather

During this project I created a simple and easy to use weather application that returns both the current and five day forecast based on your city. It returns the
temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index, and visual icon detailing weather conditions that day. Previous weather data is stored in the browser local storage
for easy access as well.
